                    Crane and Kauffman began developing Friends under the title "Insomnia Cafe" in November 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several
                    script rewrites and changes, the series was finally named "Friends" and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live audience.
                    After ten seasons on the network, the series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and viewing parties were organized around the U.S.. The finale, which was first aired on May 6, 2004, was watched by an average of 52.5 million American
                    viewers, making it the fourth most-watched series finale in television history.

                    Friends received positive reviews throughout its run, and became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. The series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards. The series was also very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking
                    in the top ten in the final primetime ratings. Friends has made a large cultural impact, and the Central Perk coffee house featured prominently in the series has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue
                    to air worldwide, while each season has been released on DVD. Following the series finale, the spin-off series Joey was created, and rumors of a film continue to circulate although have been repeatedly denied. A reunion of the main
                    cast is scheduled for broadcast on the streaming service HBO Max during 2020. However the reunion has been postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This has fuled further speculation that a new series of Friends will be commissioned.

                <li>Friends was supposed to have just four friends. Phoebe and Chandler were originally written as supporting roles. Can you even imagine?
                </li>
                <li>
                    The names of all six friends were inspired by characters from all my children. Chandler is for the Chandler family, Rachel’s last name is for Janet Green, Ross is for Ross Chandler (LOL), Monica is for Monique (Daisy Cortland), Joey is for Joseph “Joey”
                    Martin, and Phoebe is for Phoebe Tyler Wallingford.
                </li>
                <li>There’s a reason “the one where no one’s ready” takes place entirely in monica’s apartment. Showrunners used a “bottle episode” format for this season 3 favorite due to budget restrictions, as it was later revealed in the 2005 special,
                    Friends: Final Thoughts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lisa kudrow’s pregnancy was written into the show. “Here’s what was difficult about having a child: When he visited the set, it was hard to be in character,” Kudrow later said. “Because I didn’t want him to ever experience me as anything OTHER than his
                    mother.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gunther’s first line came after 33 episodes, when he said, “yeah.” Gunther also didn’t have a name until the middle of the second season, and his hair was bleached every week for 10 years because James Michael Tyler’s hair is brown IRL.
